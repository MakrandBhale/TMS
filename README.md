# TMS
Node JS server for generating dynamic signal timings based on Google Map's Traffic data

## How does it work

Send a request to the TMS server containing Latitude and Longitude values of a cross-section
It'll request Google Map's Real time traffic data, and based on that will return dynamic traffic timings.

A simple API :)
